			<p>The world has rapidly evolved, yet the way we tell stories is still linear and passive. How do we weave a cohesive narrative around the massive amounts of data, separate media silos and new interaction models? This space seeks to explore how we can re-craft the way we tell stories. Perhaps then, we can change the stories themselves.</p>

				<h2>An interactive life story</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Imagine being able to explore interactive life stories of people? It would be like visiting a museum, except for a human being. We could identify themes, or see what was happening during a lead up to a major life event. We could get a sense of how someone has navigated their chaos.</p>
